# Security Policy
Thank you for taking the time to help this project with security issues. We aim for a secure end result
at all times, but we are not perfect. Security issues might and can slip past us, just like any other.
If You believe to have found a security vulnerability in this repository, please consider reporting it 
to us so it can be fixed as soon as possible.

Please note that we have no way of offering any rewards, other than mere mentions in the project's credits.

## Supported Versions
Please note that the Piledriver project only supports the latest release with security updates.
All previous versions are obsoleted the moment a new release is published. We have no plans of doing
backports at all.

Please also note that possible vulnerabilities in the engine's code itself are outside of the scope of this policy,
unless they are directly related to the patches applied by us. Such vulnerabilities should be reported to the
engine's maintainers instead.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
If You have found a security vulnerability in our repository, please do not open a new issue, as they are public.
Instead, please contact the project's Technical Lead, [EarthlySkies](https://github.com/EarthlySkies), directly.
You should receive a response within 48 hours. Fixing the issue will be coordinated from there. 

If [EarthlySkies](https://github.com/EarthlySkies) cannot be reached, You can reach out to the Project Manager,
[Shenef](https://github.com/shenef)

## Encrypting Your messages
